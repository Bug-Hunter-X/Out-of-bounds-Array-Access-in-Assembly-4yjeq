This repository contains an example of an out-of-bounds array access bug in assembly language and its solution. The bug is caused by accessing memory outside the allocated bounds of an array, which can lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior. The solution involves adding checks to ensure that array accesses are within the valid bounds before performing any memory operations.
